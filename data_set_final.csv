0,Press release,Stand Up For Ukraine: global pledging event for refugees and internally displaced people taking place in Warsaw on 9 April 2022,30.03.2022,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_22_2169,Andean Community,"Africa || African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP)",Brussels,NOT DEFINED,"In recognition of Poland's essential role in supporting refugees fleeing the invasion of Ukraine, the Stand Up For Ukraine pledging event, convened by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau will take place in Warsaw on 9 April.
The President of Poland Andrzej Duda will participate alongside President von der Leyen, while Prime Minister Trudeau will participate remotely.
The pledging event will conclude a broader social media campaign launched by the European Commission and the Government in Canada on Saturday 26 March, in partnership with international advocacy organisation Global Citizen.  
The aim of the campaign is to raise funding and other types of support to cater for the needs of internally displaced people in Ukraine and of refugees. The campaign answers a call for support launched by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
6.5 million are internally displaced. In addition, the European Union is hosting more than 3.8 million refugees. Poland is hosting more than 2.5 million refugees and plays an important role as a humanitarian hub, dispatching to Ukraine support from all over Europe.
With no end to the conflict in sight, it is essential to provide additional resources to cover the needs of internally displaced people in Ukraine and of refugees.
“Stand Up For Ukraine” seeks to mobilise governments, institutions, artists, companies and individuals to raise funding and other types of support to cater for the needs of internally displaced people in Ukraine and of refugees.
Artists from around the world have already joined the campaign - including Bono, Madonna, Elton John, Miley Cyrus, Adam Lambert, Céline Dion or Alanis Morissette, to name just a few - and more will be joining.

1,Q&A,Questions and answers: a background for the Strategic Compass,21.03.2022,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/questions-and-answers-background-strategic-compass_en,Andean Community,"Africa || African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP)",Brussels,EEAS,"What is the Strategic Compass and what added value does it have?
EU Member States have agreed on a common strategic course of action for security and defence towards a stronger and more capable European Union: the Strategic Compass.
The Strategic Compass provides an analysis of our strategic environment and seeks to bring greater coherence and a strong common sense of purpose to the EU’s security and defence efforts. It is a guide for action, providing concrete proposals and timelines for the coming 5-10 years in four areas:

Act more quickly and decisively when facing crises;
Secure our citizens against fast-changing threats;
Invest in the capabilities and technologies we need;
Partner with others to achieve common goals.

The increasingly deteriorating security environment and, in particular, Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine underline the need to strengthen the EU security and defence. In order to tackle the broad range of threats and challenges we are confronted with, we need to step up our capacity to think and act in strategic terms and we need to do this together as Union.
The adoption of the Strategic Compass is a strong signal of unity. EU Member States, for the first time, agree on a common vision with detailed objectives of what they want to be able to achieve in security and defence. It shows their strong resolve to make the EU a more capable actor in security and defence and allows for quicker decision-making. The Compass puts forward concrete proposals, setting out a clear route for their implementation along specific timelines.
This is the result of a process that has allowed Member States to strengthen their common understanding of the threats and challenges we face and how to tackle them. Over the past two years, Member States have engaged in a strategic dialogue on the EU’s role as a security and defence actor. This is a major step towards a common strategic culture.
What is new in the Strategic Compass?
For the first time, Member States have adopted a strategic document with a common vision and detailed objectives on EU security and defence.
On substance, the Strategic Compass proposes several concrete actions in four domains (ACT, SECURE, INVEST and PARTNER). The most important and new elements are:

Developing an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity, consisting of up to 5,000 troops that can be tailored and swiftly deployed for different types of crises;
Organising regular live exercises to increase the interoperability and readiness of our armed forces;
Creating an EU Hybrid Toolbox that brings together different instruments to detect, prepare for, and respond in a coordinated manner to a broad range of hybrid threats. In parallel, we will also develop a dedicated toolbox to address and counter foreign information manipulation and interference;
Further developing the EU’s Cyber Defence Policy to be better prepared for and protect against cyberattacks;
Developing an EU Space Strategy for security and defence to strengthen our resilience and react better and faster to crises;
Developing and investing in next generation capabilities as well as the necessary strategic enablers, in particular also through collaborative capability development and joint procurement;
Committing to invest more and better, investing in technological innovation for defence and create a new Defence Innovation Hub within the European Defence Agency;
Reinforcing multilateral partnerships, in particular with NATO and the UN, through more structured political dialogues as well as operational cooperation;
Boosting cooperation with bilateral partners, in particular the United States, Norway and Canada, the UK and Japan;
Developing tailored partnerships in the Western Balkans, our eastern and southern neighbourhood, Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Why does the EU need to increase its capacity to act and how does the Strategic Compass make a difference?
The challenges we are confronted with in our neighbourhood and at global level are multifaceted and often interconnected. The return of war in Europe, increasing global and regional insecurities and crises, the return of power politics, the challenges to the international rules-based order and the proliferation of hybrid campaigns are some of the most worrying developments that directly and indirectly threaten our security. This requires the EU to make a leap forward in its capacity to act, making full use of all existing and new civilian and military instruments at its disposal.
The Strategic Compass defines how we will strengthen our readiness for fast and decisive actions, increase the effectiveness of our civilian and military missions and operations, ensure greater flexibility in our decision-making and bolster our solidarity and mutual assistance against armed aggressions.
What will the EU Rapid Deployment Capacity add to the CSDP toolbox?
We need to be able to rapidly respond to imminent crises outside the Union. This includes the ability to quickly deploy tailored forces for example for initial entry, reinforcement or as a reserve to secure an exit.
This is what the new EU Rapid Deployment Capacity (EU RDC) seeks to achieve. It can be used in different phases of an operation in a non-permissive environment. The EU RDC will consist of substantially modified EU Battlegroups (EUBGs) and of pre-identified Member States’ military forces and capabilities, including strategic enablers. The objective is to have a modular force of up to 5,000 personnel. The substantially modified EUBGs will be used, in combination with the Member States military forces and capabilities, to tailor the EU RDC to the nature of the crisis and to the requirements and objectives of the operation.
Member States will define the exact parameters of the EU RDC by the end of 2022. To that end, operational scenarios will be developed, with possible first live-exercise in 2023. The EU RDC shall be fully operational by 2025.
How will the Strategic Compass increase the effectiveness of CSDP missions and operations?
Our civilian and military missions and operations are the most visible manifestation of our Common Security and Defence Policy. They contribute to security and stability in crises and conflicts in our neighbourhood and beyond. With an increasing focus on training and advisory tasks, they also support our partners’ security and defence structures and increase local ownership. To address the fast evolving geostrategic environment, we must adapt the way we conduct our missions and operations to better respond to the increasing and complex global and regional challenges we are facing.
Through more robust, flexible and modular CSDP missions and operations, we will be able to swiftly adapt to changing circumstances and increase their effectiveness. This comprises for example the possibility for increased accompanying of our partners’ security and defence forces to ensure tailored and lasting effects, or additional training and advice on structural reforms. We will also seek mutual reinforcements of our CSDP missions and operations with European-led ad hoc missions and operations that are operating in the same theatre.
The European Peace Facility is an important element in that regard by allowing us to rapidly provide military assistance to partners to supplement our training efforts.
What are the implications specifically for civilian CSDP? 
Civilian CSDP missions contribute to global security abroad and at home. Their aim is to help prevent or resolve conflict and crises, enhance the capacities of partners and, ultimately, protect the European Union and its citizens. By summer 2023, EU Member States will make civilian CSDP more capable, more effective, flexible and responsive and more joined up with other EU instruments in light of the changed security environment. In concrete terms, the EU seeks to be able to deploy 200 civilian experts to a crisis area within 30 days.
The Civilian CSDP Compact adopted in 2018 was a milestone for our civilian CSDP engagement. Member States agreed to step up their contribution to civilian CSDP including through increased deployments to EU civilian missions, by increasing the number of women at all levels, and improving their national systems for secondment.
In the Strategic Compass, Member States have agreed to develop a new Civilian CSDP Compact by early summer 2023 when the current Civilian CSDP Compact shall be fully delivered. Furthermore, a civilian capability development process will be set-up by 2024 to assess the capability needs, develop requirements, conduct a gap analysis and review periodically the progress made in line with the new Civilian CSDP Compact.
How will the Strategic Compass increase the security of our Union and its citizens?
The more hostile security environment requires us to strengthen our resilience by better anticipating, detecting and responding to direct threats to our security.
The Strategic Compass makes concrete proposals to use our tools better to counter hybrid threats as well as to fortify our cyberdefence and cybersecurity and strengthen our capacity to dissuade and counter foreign information manipulation and interference.
In addition, we must be able to secure our access to and presence on the high seas, in the air and in outer space. We aim to further increase our resilience against climate-related risks and human-made and natural disasters while striving towards a carbon climate-neutral EU presence on the ground. We will also strengthen our ability to rescue and evacuate our citizens at risk beyond our borders. All these efforts also contribute to strengthening our solidarity and mutual assistance.
What is the concrete added value of EU hybrid toolbox?
Hybrid attacks and campaigns are often coordinated actions across different domains. There have been, for example, cyber-attacks that have included information manipulation aiming to influence electoral outcome.
To respond in a comprehensive manner to these threats, we need to be ready to mobilise all the tools and instruments that the EU has.
Acting as an overall framework, the EU hybrid toolbox will bring together relevant mechanisms, such as the cyber diplomacy toolbox and the Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference toolbox. It will improve the effectiveness and coherence of different actions, and therefore bring added value to the EU’s capacity to respond to hybrid threats.
How will the EU protect us from cyber attacks and advance a global, open, stable and secure cyberspace?
The EU will further develop the EU’s Cyber Defence Policy to protect, detect, defend and deter against cyberattacks. It will boost research and innovation, promote education and training and increase cooperation among the EU's and Member States' cyber defence actors. It will also strengthen cooperation with like-minded partners in the area of cyber defence, notably NATO.
In addition, the EU will further strengthen its EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its cyber posture to prevent, deter and respond to cyber-attacks. Further shared situational awareness, additional response measures as well as increased cooperation with like-minded partners will contribute to strengthen the EU’s ability in this regard.
The EU will step up its work to strengthen the rules-based international order, promote international security and stability, and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms online. It will advance international norms and standards that reflect these core values, by working with its international partners in the United Nations and other relevant fora. It will further intensify cyber dialogues with third countries, regional and international organisations as well as the multi-stakeholder community.
How does the Compass address the required investments to ensure that we have all the capabilities necessary to increase our capacity to act and secure our Union?
Our security does not come for free. We have known for a long time that we need step up when it comes to our defence spending. This need is now more urgent than ever.
With the Strategic Compass, Member States have committed to substantially enhance their defence spending, notably by defining, by mid-2022, objectives to increase the defence budgets and to spend them better, notably to reduce the fragmentation and increase interoperability of European capabilities. This will allow them and the Union to match their collective ambition and related needs, increase interoperability, and make use of economies of scale, including through a coordinated and collaborative European approach and the use of EU tools. Especially with the ongoing EU defence initiatives, such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund (EDF), we have already laid the groundwork for that.
Additional incentives will be proposed to stimulate Member States’ collaborative investments in strategic defence capabilities, including strategic enablers, notably those that are to be developed and/or jointly procured in EU cooperative frameworks. In that regard, the Strategic Compass includes the initiatives that the Commission has put forward in its Defence package. Member States will work on the Commission´s proposal for a value added tax (VAT) waiver, for new financing solutions, as well as a reinforced European Defence Fund (EDF) bonus system.
What will be the focus of the Strategic Compass in terms of defence capabilities, what will it bring? 
The Strategic Compass underlines the need to do more to develop high-end, cutting-edge capabilities to equip full-spectrum military forces.
We will step up our efforts to develop and acquire the needed strategic enablers, such as airlift, air refuelling, helicopters, Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance, etc. These enablers will facilitate the rapid deployment and sustainment of the necessary forces and capabilities, thus allowing the Union to conduct the full range of missions and operations as set out in its agreed level of ambition, including when using the EU Rapid Deployment Capacity.
The Compass will also guide the work on filling our critical capability gaps and further develop specific strategic capabilities, such as naval unmanned platforms, future air combat and air defence systems, platforms for space based earth observation, communication and navigation, major land platforms and related logistic systems, notably main battle tanks, as well as cyber platforms, including by making use of new technologies.
On the basis of the proposals put forward by the Commission in its Defence Package, further incentives will be developed to stimulate Member States’ collaborative investments in joint projects and joint procurement, including for example a VAT waiver, new financing solutions, or a reinforced bonus EDF system.
The capabilities will remain in the hands of Member States and will continue to be used in national, but also various multinational frameworks, including NATO or the UN.
How does the Strategic Compass link all these issues with our cooperation with partners?
The Strategic Compass emphasises that partnerships are an essential instrument to support the EU’s ambition to be global strategic player and to respond to the profound security shifts currently underway. Our partners will also benefit from a stronger and more capable EU in security and defence. Closer strategic cooperation with NATO and UN will be of utmost importance in this regard. The EU will also seek to boost its engagement with regional organisations such as the OSCE, the African Union and ASEAN.
The Strategic Compass also puts forward a range of policy initiatives and suggestions on how to engage more coherently, consistently and comprehensively with bilateral partners around the world. This engagement will be based on shared values and interests and tailored to reflect the intensity and specific characteristics of our existing relationships. Partnerships will be further developed in a way which is coherent with existing policy frameworks, whether that be in the Western Balkans, our Eastern and Southern neighbourhoods, Indo-Pacific or with the African continent.
Our bilateral partnerships will be organised around three key areas of cooperation: dialogue and cooperation on security and defence; participation of third countries in CSDP missions and operations; and supporting partners in building capacities. The EU has a long track-record of working alongside partners and we actively seek their participation in civilian and military CSDP missions and operations.
How does the Strategic Compass relate to NATO?
The current crisis has shown again how important EU-NATO cooperation is. More importantly, it has demonstrated how well EU and NATO already cooperate in reality.
The Strategic Compass clearly states the importance of our strategic partnership with NATO, and seeks to further strengthen it. The need to ensure coherence, close coordination and mutual complementarity of efforts is even more evident today, under current circumstances.
Building on the unprecedented progress achieved in the implementation of the 2016 and 2018 Joint Declarations, the Strategic Compass puts forward an array of concrete and ambitious suggestions as to how to strengthen our mutually-reinforcing and beneficial partnership.
These proposals aim at intensifying our political dialogue, including through enhanced information exchange and joint high-level meetings, statements and visits. In addition, more concrete actions for cooperation will be explored in the areas of exercises, situational awareness, military mobility, crisis management operations, maritime security, countering hybrid threats, cyber-attacks and disinformation, as well as the implementation of Women, Peace and Security agenda. Finally, the Compass aims at further expanding cooperation to new areas, such as Emerging Disruptive Technologies, climate change, resilience and space.
How does the Strategic Compass relate to the United Nations?
The Strategic Compass clearly states that to uphold rules-based multilateralism and the principles of the UN Charter, we must strengthen our strategic partnership with the United Nations (UN).
To this end, we will ensure coherence with the UN’s actions in the area of peace and security. Through our civilian and military missions and operations, we are working together with the UN in many theatres but we can do more to help reinforce, bridge or complement UN tasks and missions. In this regard, we will strengthen our strategic partnership with the UN on peace operations and crisis management, including through the implementation of the new joint set of priorities on peace operations and crisis management for 2022-2024.[1]
If the EU and UN are to meet the challenges of the future, a more dynamic approach to early warning, conflict prevention and mediation is required. Structured exchange of information, joint horizon scanning, strategic foresight and gender responsive conflict analyses can help us make best use of our knowledge and expertise. This is important if we are to respond to new and emerging challenges such as climate change, pandemics, terrorism, organised crime, emerging and disruptive technologies and hybrid threats, including cyberattacks and disinformation.
How does the Strategic Compass address the ongoing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? 
The work on the Strategic Compass was launched before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and reflects the multitude and complexity of the threats and challenges the EU faces at home and abroad. The Compass provides a long-term, strategic and global guidance for EU security and defence. At the same time, the Compass also clearly reflects the latest developments related to Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine as well as Russia’s wider destabilising role in other parts of the world. Against this background, it formulates guidance for what the EU should be capable of in the areas of security and defence.
In the current crisis, Member States stand united both in their support to Ukraine and in their broader commitments to increase the EU’s resilience and its ability to act. To that end, the EU has not only supported Ukraine in political, financial, economic and social terms. The EU has also offered an unprecedented package of military support under the European Peace Facility, including lethal equipment.
In addition to a significantly increase in defence spending in light of current events, the Compass makes additional concrete suggestions to reflect the current geostrategic environment. We will, amongst others, develop a hybrid toolbox, strengthen our tools to fight cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, and increase military mobility within and beyond the EU. We will increase our support to eastern partners and strengthen our strategic partnership with NATO and the UN, as well as with partner countries such as the US, Canada, Norway, UK and Japan.
What will happen now?
The return of war in Europe as well as the manifold threats and challenges in the global security environment call for immediate implementation. The Strategic Compass proposes concrete actions as well as timelines for their implementation.
The High Representative, in consultation with the Commission and the European Defence Agency, will present an annual report on the progress made.
The Council and the European Council will discuss and review the progress made on a regular basis.
Based on the revised threat analysis in 2025 and on the achievement of key objectives foreseen, the High Representative will present proposals on a possible revision of this Strategic Compass.

These are among the darkest hours for Europe since World War II. A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbouring country and is threatening reprisals on any other state that may come to its rescue.
This is not only the greatest violation of international law, it is a violation of the basic principles of human co-existence. It is costing many lives with unknown consequences ahead of us. 
The European Union will respond in the strongest possible terms. The President of the European Council, [Charles] Michel has called for a meeting of the European Council this evening. And they will agree and provide political guidance to adopt the strongest package, the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.
As High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union, I will be in touch with our partners around the world to ensure the international community will be fully grasping the gravity of the moment and to call strongly and united on Russia to cease immediately this intolerable behaviour and the Russian leadership will face unprecedented isolation.
This is not a question of blocs, this is not a question of diplomatic power games. It is a matter of life and death. It is about the future of our global community.
We will stand united with our transatlantic partners and with all European nations in defending this position. We stand united in saying no to violence and destruction as means to obtain political gains.
We, the European Union, remain the strongest group of nations in the world. And this should not be underestimated. We immediately will be designing urgent assistance to Ukraine in this dire situation.  
We will also be active in supporting evacuation operations, including of our own staff in zones affected by this Russian attack. 
The European Union, together with transatlantic and like-minded partners, have made unprecedented efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution to the security crisis caused by Russia, but Russia has not reciprocated these efforts and instead has opted unilaterally for a grave and premeditated escalation conducting to war. 
President [of Russia, Vladimir] Putin needs to stop this senseless aggression. Today our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. We will stand by them.

Once again, in the centre of Europe, innocent women, men and children are dying or fear for their lives. We condemn this barbaric attack, and the cynical arguments to justify it.
It is President Putin, who is bringing war back to Europe. In these dark hours, the European Union and its people stand by Ukraine and its people. We are facing an unprecedented act of aggression by the Russian leadership against a sovereign, independent country. Russia's target is not only Donbas, the target is not only Ukraine, the target is the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order. And we will hold President Putin accountable for that.
Later today, we will present a package of massive and targeted sanctions, to European Leaders for approval. With this package, we will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia. We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets. Like with the first package of sanctions, we are closely aligned with our partners and allies – the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, but also, for example, Japan and Australia. These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war.
And we know that millions of Russians do not want war. President Putin is trying to turn back the clock to the times of the Russian empire. But in doing so, he is putting at risk the future of the Russian people. I call on Russia to immediately stop the violence and to withdraw its troops from Ukraine's territory. We will not let President Putin tear down the security architecture that has given Europe peace and stability over many decades. We will not allow President Putin to replace the rule of law by the rule of force and ruthlessness. He should not underestimate the resolve and strength of our democracies.
History has proven that societies and alliances built on trust and freedom are resilient and successful. And that is exactly what the autocrats fear. The European Union stands with Ukraine and its people. We will continue to support them. Ukraine will prevail."

On the International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT), the European Union reaffirms its strong commitment to respect, protect and promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons.
Around the world, individuals continue to face violence, exclusion and discrimination on a daily basis, because of their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or sex characteristics. The EU remains particularly worried that in 69 countries consensual same-sex relationships are criminalised, with 11 of them retaining the death penalty as a legal punishment for homosexuality.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to even higher levels of violence and discrimination against LGBTI persons, including domestic violence, hate speech online and offline, and hate crimes. They often face stigma and discrimination in accessing health services. Moreover, the pandemic has led to shrinking civic space and an increase in arbitrary arrests and detentions, physical attacks and psychological trauma for human rights defenders protecting the rights of LGBTI persons. These acts are unacceptable and the EU stresses the importance of ending their impunity.
The EU takes action globally to prevent and denounce all forms of discrimination against LGBTI persons, including homophobic, biphobic and transphobic violence, while promoting their access to equal opportunities in all spheres of life. It is important that discriminatory laws, policies and practices, including the criminalisation of consenting same-sex relations are fought worldwide. Such practices also expose LGBTI persons disproportionally to unemployment, social exclusion and poverty.
The EU will remain at the forefront of efforts to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of  human rights of LGBTI persons. Through its renewed internal and external policy framework, notably the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2020-2024) and the European Commission’s first ever LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020-2025, the EU advances equality in all spheres of life both inside and outside the EU.
In line with this year’s IDAHOT theme “Together: Resisting, Supporting, Healing!”, the EU will continue to address discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, highlighting the vulnerable situation of LGBTI persons in the COVID-19 recovery and calling for fairer, more inclusive and sustainable societies. It will engage through political dialogue with partner countries and continue to support civil society organisations and human rights defenders for the protection and promotion of the full and equal enjoyment of human rights of LGBTI persons and the respect for diversity.
Ensuring the right of all individuals to be free to be who they are and love whom they choose requires joint efforts by all, every day.
The Candidate Countries the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania[1], the country of the Stabilisation and Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia align themselves with this declaration.

As the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the world, the European Union and its Member States have observed cyber threats and malicious cyber activities targeting essential operators in Member States and their international partners, including in the healthcare sector. Since the beginning of the pandemic, significant phishing and malware distribution campaigns, scanning activities and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have been detected, some affecting critical infrastructures that are essential to managing this crisis.
The European Union and its Member States condemn this malicious behaviour in cyberspace, express solidarity with all countries that are victims of malicious cyber activities and underline their continued support to increase global cyber resilience.
Any attempt to hamper the ability of critical infrastructures is unacceptable. All perpetrators must immediately refrain from conducting such irresponsible and destabilising actions, which can put people’s lives at risk. We need the entire world to stand united in this global fight against the virus. It is a matter of humanity and universally shared values.
The European Union and its Member States share a common vision of the cyber threats and are resolute to prevent, discourage, deter and respond to them, notably through the continued exchange of information and incident handling cooperation, as well as the use of their framework for a joint EU diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities. To this end, the European Union and its Member States will further reinforce their cooperation at technical, operational, judicial and diplomatic levels, including with their international partners.
The European Union and its Member States call upon every country to exercise due diligence and take appropriate actions against actors conducting such activities from its territory, consistent with international law and the 2010, 2013 and 2015 consensus reports of the United Nations Groups of Governmental Experts (UNGGEs) in the field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security. The ongoing work of the sixth UNGGE and the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in the field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security is crucial to strengthening international cooperation towards a global, open, stable, peaceful and secure cyberspace where human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law fully apply.
The European Union and its Member States stand together with all those affected by the coronavirus pandemic around the world.

The Candidate Countries Turkey, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania[1], the country of the Stabilisation and Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Armenia align themselves with this declaration.
[1] The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania continue to be part of the Stabilisation and Association Process.

""This year we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history that has helped transform children's lives around the world for the better. 
On this day, the European Union reconfirms its determination to making sure that every child has every right. Children need to be able to grow up in a safe and nurturing environment – free from violence, exploitation, harassment or neglect. Within our Union and in our external actions - whether in situations of conflict or peace - the Convention guides EU policy, legislation and financial programmes that have an impact on the rights of children. All EU Member States are party to the Convention and together we have strong national and EU legal frameworks that serve to protect children from abuse and exploitation. 
Despite all efforts, 25 million children in the EU and 19.5% of the world's children continue to live in poverty. Children across the globe are victims of abuse, exploitation and trafficking. Children suffer from mental health problems, are victims of bullying and commit suicide. We still have a long way to go to make sure that all children regardless of their place of origin, socio-economic background and migration status can fully enjoy their childhood. 
The Convention has also contributed to changing the way the world looks at children: from looking at them as a group of people who need protection, the world starts to recognise children as rights holders, who can play an active role in shaping society. The EU is convinced that in order to ensure children's rights without further delay, we need their meaningful participation. On the occasion of the Convention's 30th anniversary, the EU and UNICEF have recently launched #TheRealChallenge social media campaign to engage with children and young people on their rights in a language they understand and via a platform they know. 
Today, the EU recommits to the principles of the Convention and to giving children the priority they deserve. Investing in children is not only a moral duty but also an essential investment in a better present and future for all of us.""
  Background
The European Union supports EU Member States with concrete funding to translate child-friendly justice frameworks that facilitate children's access to justice, their appropriate representation in front of court and diligent treatment of juvenile delinquents. All EU Member States were required to transpose the Directive on procedural safeguards for children who are suspects or accused in criminal proceedings by 11 June 2019.
The EU has dedicated funding for combating violence against children, including on harmful practices under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship programme. In 2018, more than €15 million was dedicated to finance projects preventing and combating gender-based violence and violence against children in the EU.
Through the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children, the EU defines measures to protect and empower children online and to promote a multi-stakeholder approach to reach a safer digital environment. The backbone of these efforts is the EU funded Safer Internet Centres, with the Betteinternetforkids.eu portal as central hub. The #SaferInternet4EU campaign promoting online safety, media literacy and cyber-hygiene reached nearly 30 million EU citizens. 
The EU is facilitating the inclusion of young refugees into European communities as much as possible. While challenges remain, good practice models  in Member States leads the way to better integration. The EU also protects children on migration routes:our initiatives support safe zones, deploy child protection teams and improve access to qualified guardianship for unaccompanied children. Nearly one in four registered victims of human trafficking in the EU is a child. We are working to prevent these crimes and to ensure that perpetrators are held fully accountable.
The European Union believes that every child has the right of access to protection, nutrition, healthcare and education. This year, the EU will allocate a record 10% of its humanitarian budget to education in emergencies to help crisis-affected children stay in school, foster their sense of normality, and to provide them with perspectives for a better future. So far in 2019, the EU has allocated nearly €64 million to child protection activities in humanitarian contexts. 
The EU's commitment to fight child labour translates into targeted action in our trade engagements: the integrated approach for cotton from West Africa and for fishery in South-East Asia, involving also trade partners and communities, is showing promising results. 
For more than 30 years, we have been working together with UN agencies, EU Member States, partner countries, civil society, and regional organisations to create a world free of violence against children. With the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative we are leading a global and multilayered work to raise awareness for all forms of violence against women and girls in South-East Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Pacific and the Caribbean. We support programs by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA) to address child, early and forced marriage and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). So far, the programs have successfully contributed to the establishment of national action plans to end FGM in 12 target countries. Behind each visual depicting child pornography, there is a child victim. We support multi-stakeholder initiatives aiming to improve the effectiveness of the fight against these crimes, such as WePROTECT Global Alliance to End Child Sexual Exploitation Online.
EU projects in Cambodia, Myanmar, Georgia, Burundi and Armenia help children without parental care to grow up in supportive families or communities and our initiatives in as many as 17 enlargement and neighbourhood partners contribute to preventing the separation of families and strengthening quality alternative care for children without sufficient parental care."

The Council recognises that the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening progress towards the SDGs and therefore calls for enhanced dialogue and concrete operational actions to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs.
The Council calls on the Commission to propose such actions in conjunction with the delivery of the Commission President’s headline ambitions ""A European Green Deal"". The Commission is also invited to engage in regular dialogue with the Council to further promote an integrated, strategic, ambitious and comprehensive approach to SDG implementation. This dialogue should take stock of progress made in the implementation of the SDGs at EU level in an integrated and coherent way and address strategic orientations.
The conclusions call on the Commission and EU member states to carry out communications and awareness-raising campaigns on the 2030 Agenda with a view to increasing shared ownership by the citizens, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders.
The Council remains committed towards reviewing progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and will step up efforts to mainstream the SDGs in its work across policy sectors.
