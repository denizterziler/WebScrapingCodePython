In its conclusions the Council expresses its deep concern about the global spread of the COVID‑19 pandemic, which continues to claim lives worldwide and have far-reaching social and economic effects.
The Council stresses the urgency of protecting the lives and livelihoods of all people, leaving no-one behind, and of prioritising efforts in partner countries that are most in need.
In light of that the Council fully supports the ""Team Europe"" approach and welcomes the announcement that almost 36 billion euro have now been mobilised and will be used to address the devastating effects of the COVID-19 crisis in partner countries and regions.
The Council conclusions call for full and effective implementation of a package that should allocate resources to partner countries in cooperation with them, and on the basis of a joint assessment of needs.
The Council also emphasises the need to ensure a link with medium- and long-term programming, and proper coordination with all actors involved, including the UN, regional organisations such as the African Union, and other international multilateral organisations and financial institutions.
Background
The ""Team Europe"" package was launched on 8 April 2020 to support EU partner countries in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. The financial support initially pledged was around 20 billion euro and combined resources from the EU, its member states, and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

At a time when the world is joining efforts to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, human rights must remain at the core of our battle. On this day, we give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been victims of torture and those who are still tortured today.
Torture and other ill-treatment can never be justified. The prohibition of torture is absolute - the use of torture is illegal under all circumstances. The European Union reaffirms its strong commitment to combating torture worldwide through a comprehensive approach encompassing prohibition, prevention, accountability and redress for the victims.
The eradication of torture is a global challenge; it should be a global ambition. It is not impossible to achieve, but can only be done if we act together. Joint efforts with international partners, in particular the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the International Criminal Court, regional organisations, national partners and civil society can make a real difference. The Global Alliance for Torture-Free Trade is a good example of how we can work together and we call on all States to join it.
The European Union reiterates its call for a universal ratification and effective implementation of the UN Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol. With 170 States parties to the Convention, most recently Angola and Oman, universality is within reach; only 25 States still have to ratify it.
Through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the EU supports civil society organisations working to prevent torture and assist victims worldwide. Concretely, over the past decade, the European Union has allocated more than €80 million to support those at the forefront of this work. We will continue to stand by human rights defenders who courageously engage against torture around the world."
2,Statement/Declaration,"World Refugee Day, 20 June 2020: Joint Statement by the European Commission and the High Representative",19.06.2020,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_1128,Uganda,"#UN75, Africa, Andorra, Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Eastern Partnership, Europe and Central Asia, Faroe Islands, French Southern Territories, Greenland, Human Rights & Democracy, Latin America & the Caribbean, Liechtenstein, Middle East & North Africa (MENA), Monaco, North America, North Korea, Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), Pacific, Refugee protection & Migration, St Pierre and Miquelon, United Nations (UN), Western Balkans, Western Europe",Brussels,NOT DEFINED,"On the occasion of World Refugee Day, on 20 June, the European Commission and the High Representative made the following statement:
""This year, World Refugee Day comes at a time when the world is facing a global pandemic that has already cost the lives of thousands of people and is affecting the livelihood of millions more. The struggle is even harder for refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants and stateless persons. With limited or no access to medical care and protection mechanisms, these people are more vulnerable to the effects of this global crisis.
One in every 97 people on earth have been displaced because of conflict or persecution. By the end of 2019, almost 80 million people in the world have been forced to leave their homes. This includes nearly 26 million refugees, 4.2 million asylum seekers, around 45.7 million internally displaced people, and 3.6 million Venezuelans displaced abroad.
The coronavirus does not discriminate between people and knows no borders. Its scale has required a fast and coordinated global response, based on international solidarity. No one must be left behind. Vulnerable populations, including refugees, are at the heart of the EU's Global response to the coronavirus crisis. The European Union reaffirms its unwavering solidarity with the millions of people who have to flee their country, at times leaving their families behind, because their home is no longer safe.
The EU is committed to the respect of the Geneva Convention for Refugees, which is the cornerstone for the protection of refugees, and to preserve the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is essential that even during the pandemic, fundamental principles continue to apply globally so that those in need can continue accessing procedures for international protection and finding shelter, also through resettlement. Countries most exposed, including those hosting thousands of refugees, must be helped to face the difficulties they encounter. The EU recognises its share of responsibility for offering protection to those in need and supporting other countries. EU Member States pledged to resettle almost 30,000 refugees in 2020, representing 40% of all resettlement pledges worldwide. The Commission will continue to support Member States to fulfil their pledges.
The EU is at the forefront of the global response to this pandemic. The Team Europe approach, that combines resources from the EU, its Member States and financial institutions, responds to the humanitarian needs in health, water and sanitation systems caused by the crisis, including for the benefit of refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons. It also reinforces partner countries' capacities to deal with the pandemic and to mitigate its socio-economic impact, in particular on groups at risk, such as refugees and host communities from Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh to Kakuma in Kenya, Zaatari in Jordan, and Barranquilla, in Colombia.
Refugees can be catalysts for positive change. This was confirmed by the first Global Refugee Forum in December 2019 where the international community was called upon to share the responsibility, in line with the Global Compact on Refugees. Today, we pay tribute to the many refugees working on the frontlines to fight the coronavirus in Europe, in many cases putting their own health at risk, to save others. Their contribution is vital.
Integration is a priority for this Commission. The EU has put in place a robust set of measures to ensure that newly arrived people have access to essential services such as education, social welfare, healthcare and accommodation.
The European Union is founded on democratic values and respect for human rights. To that end, we will continue to play a leading role in guaranteeing the protection of refugees."""

This amendment, put forward through a fast-track process, will provide extra resources for the reception of persons fleeing the war in Ukraine.
The proposed text will extend by one year the implementation period of the 2014-2020 home affairs funds and unlock access to unspent amounts in the asylum and migration fund which had previously been earmarked for other purposes. This will enable member states to urgently use the remaining funds to help address the mass influx of persons fleeing the war and is expected to release around €420 million in additional support from unused funds.
The text also provides member states and other public or private donors with the possibility to make additional financial contributions under the 2021-2027 fund as external assigned revenue. This external assigned revenue will allow to finance asylum and migration activities in member states during crises, including those arising from the invasion of Ukraine.
On 24 February 2022, Russian armed forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a result, substantial areas of Ukrainian territory now constitute areas of armed conflict from which thousands of persons are fleeing. On that same day, the European Council condemned Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and demanded Russia’s full respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.
The EU has shown, and will continue to show, its resolute support for Ukraine and its citizens. On 4 March the Council unanimously adopted an implementing decision introducing temporary protection for persons fleeing the war. On 8 March the Commission presented, among other measures, a proposal to amend the home affairs funds to unlock extra resources for member states to ensure adequate reception facilities and effective procedures.

5,Press release,Ukraine: Council approves swift release of cohesion resources to help refugees,16.03.2022,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/16/ukraine-council-approves-swift-release-of-cohesion-resources-for-ukrainian-refugees,African Union (AU),"Africa, African Union (AU), Andorra, Asia, Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Eastern Partnership, Europe and Central Asia, Faroe Islands, French Southern Territories, Greenland, Humanitarian & Emergency Response, Human Rights & Democracy, Latin America & the Caribbean, Liechtenstein, Middle East & North Africa (MENA), Monaco, North America, North Korea, Organisation for Security&Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), Pacific, Refugee protection & Migration, Security, Defence & Crisis Response, St Pierre and Miquelon, Ukraine, United Nations (UN), Western Balkans, Western Europe",Not Specified,Council of the EU,"The Council today endorsed a legislative proposal that will mobilise cohesion policy funding to assist refugees fleeing Russia’s military aggression.
The measure will also reinforce member states’ ongoing efforts to tackle the extended impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The European Union has already welcomed nearly three million displaced persons, mostly women and children, fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A place to stay, essential necessities, access to healthcare, transport, education and employment – Europe has to abide by its values for the Ukrainian people. The swift release of cohesion resources for the displaced persons will allow member states, especially those on the frontline of the crisis, to urgently allocate funding to help the displaced Ukrainians as much as possible. This was the strong commitment made by the EU leaders when they met at Versailles on 10 and 11 March, and now we are proud to live up to this commitment.
The proposal on Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) amends two legislative acts to provide for exceptional and targeted changes to the overall 2014-2020 legal framework governing the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived (FEAD).
It also introduces extra flexibility in reallocation of funding and extends by one accounting year the 100% financing from the EU budget for cohesion programmes, a measure initially introduced in 2020 to help the COVID-19 recovery.
This means that member states will be able to speed up the deployment of all unprogrammed funding under the 2014-2020 period. Additionally, they can use the €10 billion 2022 tranche under REACT-EU, one of the largest post-pandemic EU public investment programmes.
The main elements of the proposal include:
Bearing in mind the urgency of the human and economic impact of the refugee inflow, the Council decided to endorse the text of the proposal without amendment.
On 8 March the European Commission proposed the CARE regulation. The proposal aims to alleviate the burden on national and regional budgets from the unprecedented migratory pressure, especially in the EU’s eastern regions, resulting from the unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine. It also takes into account the extended economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EU as a whole.
Following today’s endorsement by the Council, the European Parliament is expected to use the urgent procedure for the approval of the proposal. The legislative act is expected to be adopted in early April and will enter into force with immediate effect.

We are adding to our sanctions list even more oligarchs and regime-affiliated elites, their families and prominent businesspeople, which are involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the regime. These sanctions also target those who have a leading role in disinformation and propaganda that accompany President Putin’s war against Ukrainian people. Our message is clear: Those who enable the invasion of Ukraine pay a price for their actions.
The listed individuals include key oligarchs Roman Abramovich and German Khan as well as other prominent businesspeople involved in key economic sectors, such as iron and steel, energy, banking, media, military and dual use products and services. The list also includes lobbyists and propagandists, such as Konstantin Ernst (CEO of Channel One Russia) who are pushing the Kremlin’s narrative on the situation in Ukraine.
Sanctioned entities include companies in the aviation, military and dual use, shipbuilding and machine building sectors.
This decision is part of a fourth package of restrictive measures imposed by the EU against Russia in view of its military aggression against Ukraine.
Altogether, EU restrictive measures now apply to a total of 877 individuals and 62 entities. Those designated are subject to an asset freeze and EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to them. Natural persons are additionally subject to a travel ban, which prevents them from entering or transiting through EU territories. The Council recently decided to prolong the sanctions targeting those responsible for undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine for a further six months until 15 September 2022.
Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global security and stability. It is inflicting unspeakable suffering on the Ukrainian population. Russia, and its accomplice Belarus, bear full responsibility for this war of aggression and those responsible will be held to account for their crimes, including for indiscriminately targeting civilians and civilian objects.
The European Union demands that Russia ceases its military action and withdraws all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine immediately and unconditionally, and fully respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders.
